	Abstract                 = {The development and operation of liquid-argon time-projection chambers for neutrino physics has created a need for new approaches to pattern recognition in order to fully exploit the imaging capabilities offered by this technology. Whereas the human brain can excel at identifying features in the recorded events, it is a significant challenge to develop an automated, algorithmic solution. The Pandora Software Development Kit provides functionality to aid the design and implementation of pattern-recognition algorithms. It promotes the use of a multi-algorithm approach to pattern recognition, in which individual algorithms each address a specific task in a particular topology. Many tens of algorithms then carefully build up a picture of the event and, together, provide a robust automated pattern-recognition solution. This paper describes details of the chain of over one hundred Pandora algorithms and tools used to reconstruct cosmic-ray muon and neutrino events in the MicroBooNE detector. Metrics that assess the current pattern-recognition performance are presented for simulated MicroBooNE events, using a selection of final-state event topologies.},

  Abstract                 = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,062 new measurements from 721 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including those on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group ( http://pdg.lbl.gov [http://pdg.lbl.gov] ). The printed PDG Book contains the Summary Tables and all review articles but no longer includes the detailed tables from the Particle Listings. A Booklet with the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the review articles is also available. ----- -- Contents ----- --   ----- -- Abstract, Contributors, Highlights and Table of Contents -- Acrobat PDF (150 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0001-0010.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Introduction -- Acrobat PDF (456 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0011-0026.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Particle Physics Summary Tables ----- -- Gauge and Higgs bosons -- Acrobat PDF (155 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0029-0031.pdf] ----- -- Leptons -- Acrobat PDF (134 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0032-0035.pdf] ----- -- Quarks -- Acrobat PDF (84 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0036.pdf] ----- -- Mesons -- Acrobat PDF (871 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0037-0086.pdf] ----- -- Baryons -- Acrobat PDF (300 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0087-0102.pdf] ----- -- Searches (Supersymmetry, Compositeness, etc.) -- Acrobat PDF (91 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0103-0104.pdf] ----- -- Tests of conservation laws -- Acrobat PDF (330 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0105-0116.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Reviews, Tables, and Plots ----- -- Detailed contents for this section -- Acrobat PDF (37 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0117-0118.pdf] ----- -- Constants, Units, Atomic and Nuclear Properties -- Acrobat PDF (278 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0119-0131.pdf] ----- -- Standard Model and Related Topics -- Acrobat PDF (7.3 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0132-0348.pdf] ----- -- Astrophysics and Cosmology -- Acrobat PDF (2.7 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0349-0428.pdf] ----- -- Experimental Methods and Colliders -- Acrobat PDF (3.8 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0429-0516.pdf] ----- -- Mathematical Tools or Statistics, Monte Carlo, GroupTheory       -- Acrobat PDF (1.3 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0517-0559.pdf] ----- -- Kinematics, Cross-Section Formulae, and Plots -- Acrobat PDF (3.9 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0560-0598.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Particle Listings ----- -- Illustrative key and abbreviations -- Acrobat PDF (235 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0601-0610.pdf] ----- -- Gauge and Higgs bosons -- Acrobat PDF (2 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0613-0710.pdf] ----- -- Leptons -- Acrobat PDF (1.5 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0711-0790.pdf] ----- -- Quarks -- Acrobat PDF (1.2 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0791-0846.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Light unflavored and strange -- Acrobat PDF (4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_0847-1043.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Charmed and bottom -- Acrobat PDF (7.4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1044-1363.pdf] ----- -- Mesons: Other -- Acrobat PDF (3.1 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1364-1500.pdf] ----- -- Baryons -- Acrobat PDF (3.97 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1501-1672.pdf] ----- -- Miscellaneous searches -- Acrobat PDF (2.4 MB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1673-1790.pdf] ----- --   ----- -- Index -- Acrobat PDF (160 KB) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1674-1137/40/10/100001/media/rpp2016_1791-1808.pdf] -----},

The data model has been revised, allowing for efficient track merging, smoothing, residual calculation, alignment, and storage.},

Addressing these questions requires a new generation of massive particle detectors to explore the subatomic and astrophysical worlds. ICARUS T600 is the first large mass (760 tons) example of a new generation of detectors able to combine the imaging capabilities of the old famous ``bubble chamber'' with the excellent energy measurement of huge electronic detectors. ICARUS T600 now operates at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory and is used to study cosmic rays, neutrino oscillations and the proton decay. The potential for doing physics of this novel telescope is presented through a few examples of neutrino interactions reconstructed with unprecedented detail. Detector design and early operation are also reported.},
